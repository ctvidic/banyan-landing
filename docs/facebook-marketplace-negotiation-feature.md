# Facebook Marketplace Car Negotiation Feature

## Overview
An AI-powered feature where users can practice negotiating for cars on a mock Facebook Marketplace interface. Users select from 5 different car listings and engage in realistic negotiation conversations with AI sellers.

## Core Concept
- Users input a mock Facebook Marketplace car listing URL or select from pre-made options
- AI pretends to be the seller with distinct personality and negotiation style
- Users practice negotiation skills through phone/chat conversations
