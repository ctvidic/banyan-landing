## Solutions
### fix tts
* fix VAD and icon so that talking isnt so bad
* use streaming so that it's quicker
* allow interruptions
* ***a little bit of a delay is probably okay, but it needs to be less jarring***

### implement eleven labs
* would probably need to ask chris for help
* a lot of extra work I think
