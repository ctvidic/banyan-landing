# Bill Negotiator - Fair Grading System Explained

## How We Calculate Your Score

The grading system now properly evaluates complex telecom deals by calculating the **effective monthly rate** over a 12-month period.

### Deal Types We Handle

#### 1. **Simple Monthly Discounts**
- Example: "$10 off per month"
- Calculation: $89 - $10 = $79/month effective rate
- Grade: ⭐⭐⭐ (3 stars for $70-79 range)

#### 2. **Limited-Time Offers**
- Example: "$15 off for 6 months only"
- Calculation: ($74×6 + $89×6) ÷ 12 = $81.50/month effective
- Grade: ⭐⭐ (2 stars for $80-84 range)

#### 3. **Graduated Pricing**
- Example: "$64 for 6 months, then $74 for 6 months"
- Calculation: ($64×6 + $74×6) ÷ 12 = $69/month effective
- Grade: ⭐⭐⭐⭐ (4 stars for hitting original price)

#### 4. **One-Time Credits**
- Example: "$120 credit + $5/month off"
- Calculation: $84 - ($120÷12) = $74/month effective
- Grade: ⭐⭐⭐ (3 stars for $70-79 range)

#### 5. **Bundle Deals**
- Example: "Internet + TV for $99 (internet portion: $74)"
- Calculation: Uses only internet portion ($74)
- Grade: ⭐⭐⭐ (3 stars)

### Star Rating Breakdown

| Effective Monthly Rate | Stars | What It Means |
|------------------------|-------|---------------|
| $85+ | ⭐ | Minimal savings achieved |
| $80-84 | ⭐⭐ | Some negotiation success |
| $70-79 | ⭐⭐⭐ | Good negotiation |
| $69 | ⭐⭐⭐⭐ | Back to original price! |
| <$69 | ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ | Exceptional negotiation! |

### Bonus Points
You can earn up to +1 star for:
- Successfully escalating to supervisor (+0.5)
- Negotiating favorable contract terms (+0.5)
- Getting price lock guarantees (+0.5)
- Avoiding long commitments for good prices (+1)

### Why This Is Fair

1. **Compares Apples to Apples**: All deals are converted to effective monthly rates
2. **Rewards True Value**: A "$10 off for 6 months" isn't as good as "$5 off permanently"
3. **Considers Total Cost**: Looks at what you'll actually pay over a year
4. **Credits Smart Negotiation**: Bonus points for tactics beyond just price
