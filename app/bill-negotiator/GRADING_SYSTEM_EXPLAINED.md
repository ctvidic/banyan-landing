# Bill Negotiator - Fair Grading System Explained

## How We Calculate Your Score

The grading system evaluates your negotiation by calculating the **effective monthly rate** of your **final accepted deal** over a 12-month period.

### Important: Only Your Final Deal Counts!

The scoring system identifies and grades ONLY the final offer you accepted, ignoring all previous offers that were rejected. For example:

**Negotiation Flow:**
- Agent: "I can offer $5 off for 6 months" → You: "That's not enough"
- Agent: "How about $10 off for 6 months?" → You: "I need better"  
- Agent: "Best I can do is $69/month for 12 months" → You: "OK, I'll take that"

**What Gets Scored:** Only the $69/month deal (4 stars!)  
**What Gets Ignored:** The $5 and $10 offers you rejected

### How We Identify Your Final Deal

1. **Explicit Acceptance**: You say "OK", "Deal", "I'll take it", "That works"
2. **Agent Confirmation**: Agent says "I've applied that to your account"
3. **Call Ended During Discussion**: The last offer being discussed
4. **No Deal Reached**: You pay full price ($89/month)

### Deal Types We Handle

#### 1. **Simple Monthly Discounts**
- Example: "$10 off per month"
- Calculation: $89 - $10 = $79/month effective rate
- Grade: ⭐⭐⭐ (3 stars for $70-79 range)

#### 2. **Limited-Time Offers**
- Example: "$15 off for 6 months only"
- Calculation: ($74×6 + $89×6) ÷ 12 = $81.50/month effective
- Grade: ⭐⭐ (2 stars for $80-84 range)

#### 3. **Graduated Pricing**
- Example: "$64 for 6 months, then $74 for 6 months"
- Calculation: ($64×6 + $74×6) ÷ 12 = $69/month effective
- Grade: ⭐⭐⭐⭐ (4 stars for hitting original price)

#### 4. **One-Time Credits**
- Example: "$120 credit + $5/month off"
- Calculation: $84 - ($120÷12) = $74/month effective
- Grade: ⭐⭐⭐ (3 stars for $70-79 range)

#### 5. **Bundle Deals**
- Example: "Internet + TV for $99 (internet portion: $74)"
- Calculation: Uses only internet portion ($74)
- Grade: ⭐⭐⭐ (3 stars)

# Bill Negotiator - Simple & Fair Grading System

## How We Calculate Your Score

The grading system evaluates your negotiation based on your **final accepted deal**. Your starting bill is $89/month.

### Important: Only Your Final Deal Counts!

The scoring system grades ONLY the final offer you accepted, ignoring all rejected offers.

**Example:**
- Agent: "I can offer $5 off" → You: "Not enough"
- Agent: "How about $10 off?" → You: "Need better"  
- Agent: "Best I can do is $20 off" → You: "OK, deal"

**What Gets Scored:** Only the $20 off (final bill: $69/month) → 4 stars!

### Two Types of Offers

#### Type A: Monthly Discount
- **What it is:** Permanent reduction to your monthly bill
- **Example:** "$15 off per month"
- **Calculation:** $89 - $15 = $74/month
- **Your bill:** $74 every month going forward

#### Type B: One-Time Credit
- **What it is:** A credit applied once to your account
- **Example:** "$120 credit"
- **Your monthly bill:** Still $89 (no change)
- **For scoring:** We spread it over 12 months
- **Effective rate:** $89 - ($120÷12) = $79/month
