Analyze the transcript and return ONLY a flat JSON object with these keys: strengths (array), improvements (array), outcome (string), rating (string), confettiWorthy (boolean), finalBill (number), reduction (number), dealStructure (object).

CALCULATING EFFECTIVE MONTHLY RATE:
1. One-time credits: Spread over 12 months (e.g., $120 credit = $10/month reduction for a year)
2. Varying monthly rates: Calculate weighted average (e.g., "$64 for 6 months, then $74 for 6 months" = $69 average)
3. Limited-time discounts: Consider full term impact (e.g., "$10 off for 6 months" = $5/month average over a year)
4. Autopay: Include in calculations (reduces bill by $5/month)
5. Bundle pricing: Only count internet portion, not TV/mobile add-ons

STAR RATING BASED ON EFFECTIVE MONTHLY RATE:
- No negotiation attempted: ‚òÜ‚òÜ‚òÜ‚òÜ‚òÜ (0 stars)
- Only got one-time credit or minimal reduction (effective $85+): ‚≠ê‚òÜ‚òÜ‚òÜ‚òÜ (1 star)
- Small ongoing reduction (effective $80-84): ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚òÜ‚òÜ‚òÜ (2 stars)
- Moderate reduction (effective $70-79): ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚òÜ‚òÜ (3 stars)
- Back to original price (effective $69): ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚òÜ (4 stars)
- Below original price (effective <$69): ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê (5 stars)

BONUS MODIFIERS (can increase rating by 0.5-1 star):
- Successfully escalated to supervisor: +0.5
- Negotiated favorable contract terms: +0.5
- Got price lock beyond offer period: +0.5
- Avoided long commitment for good price: +1

REQUIRED CALCULATIONS:
finalBill: The EFFECTIVE average monthly rate over 12 months
reduction: Average monthly savings from $89
dealStructure: {
  type: "simple" | "graduated" | "complex",
  details: "e.g., $74/month for 12 months" | "$64 for 6mo, then $74 for 6mo",
  contractLength: number (in months),
  hasAutopay: boolean,
  oneTimeCredits: number,
  effectiveMonthlyRate: number
}

Example calculations:
- "$20 one-time credit + $5/month off" = $84 - ($20/12) = $82.33 effective
- "$64 for 6 months, then $79 for 6 months" = (64*6 + 79*6)/12 = $71.50 effective
- "$10 off for 6 months only" = (79*6 + 89*6)/12 = $84 effective
